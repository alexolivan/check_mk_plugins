 This plugin is intended to monitor the status of configured 
 VHosts of SWowza Stream Engine streaming servers in the
 local machine.

 The agent binds to the serverstats XML server listening at
 8086 port on a Wowza Stream Engine running instance.
 It needs authorization, so IT NEEDS TO BE CONFIGURED by 
 entering appropriate host, user an password.
 It wgets and updates an XML file in tmp storage containing
 recent server status.

 It uses a separate python script to parse the XML:
 wowza_xml_parser.py
 Ensure this script is present on the agent plugin folder.
 It is possible to have the script elsewhere and update the 
 agent PARSER variable path wit the correct path to it.

 Every correctly fetched configured VHOST is added to the
 agent output and will generate a item on check_mk plugin.


 Example output from agent:
 _defaultVHost_ 0 0 17 15 2
 ExampleVhost1 0 0 6768 6702 66
 ExampleVHost2 0 19 156579 153958 2621
 Demo 0 0 0 0 0
